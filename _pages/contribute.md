The stock licencing protocol is built and maintained by the stock licensing community.  There will be many ways to contribute in the future but right now we are in the beginning phasess.  We plan to make our work in progress code public on [our github](https://github.com/Stock-Licensing-Protocol) very soon.  

In the mean time, this website is managed on Github and could use improvements and more blog posts.  If you are familiar with a Github workflow and have ideas how to improve the website or want to contribute a blog post then check out the [stock-licensing-protocol.github.io repo readme](https://github.com/Stock-Licensing-Protocol/stock-licensing-protocol.github.io) for more details on how to submit pull requests or blog posts.
